The Field Service Analytics app brings the power of Analytics to Field Service Lightning on any device that supports Salesforce Analytics. With intuitive visualizations based on your field service data, the app provides instant analytics for field service managers and dispatchers. You get clear data insights to improve every on-site experience. Field Services Analytics empowers managers with answers to help their technicians deliver personalized, actionable customer service.
<br> </br>
Field Service Analytics works only with Field Service Lightning-enabled orgs that have migrated to the new standard object model. If you're unsure if your org includes Field Service Lightning, go to Setup and enter Field Service in the Quick Find/Search box. If Field Service Settings doesn't appear in Setup, your org will not support Field Service Analytics app creation. Contact your Salesforce representative for more information.
